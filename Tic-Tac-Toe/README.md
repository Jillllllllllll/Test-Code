这是一个简单的三子棋小游戏

也是我写出的第一个游戏

用了很久很久去调试,编写自己的头函数

现在应该已经没有任何问题了

祝你玩的愉快!

P.S. 这个计算机的代码是随机落子的,所以它很多时候会很傻,天啊

This is a simple backgammon mini-game

It was also the first game I wrote

It took a long, long time to debug and write my own header functions

There should be no problems anymore

Have fun!

P.S. The code for this computer is random, so it's going to be silly a lot of the time, oh my god
